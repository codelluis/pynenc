   Note that in Pynenc, tasks cannot be defined in Python modules intended to run as standalone scripts
   (where `__name__` is set to `"__main__"`). This includes modules executed directly or using the
   `python -m module` command. To learn more about this limitation and its implications, refer to the
   [FAQ section](faq.rst) or the detailed explanation in the [Usage Guide](usage_guide.rst).
