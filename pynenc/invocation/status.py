    """
    An enumeration representing the status of a task invocation.

    Attributes
    ----------
    REGISTERED : str
        The task call has been routed and is registered
    PENDING : str
        The task call was picked by a runner but is not yet executed.
        (config.max_pending_seconds)
        The status pending will expire after Config.max_pending_seconds
    RUNNING : str
        The task call is currently running.
    SUCCESS : str
        The task call finished without errors.
    PAUSED : str
        The task call execution is paused.
    SCHEDULED : str
        A task has been registered to run at a specific time. This is a subtype of REGISTERED.
    FAILED : str
        The task call finished with exceptions.
    RETRY : str
        The task call finished with a retriable exception.

    Notes
    -----
    FAILED, RETRY, and SUCCESS are the same category and can be considered as subtypes of a hypothetical TERMINATED status.
