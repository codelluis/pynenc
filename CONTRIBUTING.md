# Contributing to pynenc

Thank you for your interest in contributing to pynenc! At this moment, the project is in its initial development phase and is not yet ready for contributions from the community. We are working hard to reach a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and establish a solid foundation for the project.

Once the project reaches a stage where we are ready to accept contributions, we will update this CONTRIBUTING guide with detailed instructions on how to contribute. In the meantime, feel free to watch the repository for updates and engage in discussions in the issues.

We appreciate your understanding and look forward to collaborating with you in the near future!

Best regards,
Pynenc
